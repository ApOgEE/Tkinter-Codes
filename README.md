# APOGEE Tkinter-Codes

I think there are coders who would like to explore Python and tkinter like me. 
Searching from sites to sites to find example codes to test and learn.

So, this is my version. As this is the place where I will be sharing my codes on python tkinter. 

I'm currently coding in `MacOS Mojave` and `Ubuntu` since I don't have Windows to test my codes.

Feel free to leave your comments or open an issue.
